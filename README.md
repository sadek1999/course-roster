## State Management
In this project, we manage the application state using React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks. These hooks are part of React's core library and are used to handle state and side effects within individual components.

- useState : In my project I use useState for Tracking the data and organized the components . by the useState easily Transfer the data one components to another components .
- useEffect : In the project I use  useEffect hook for load the data from the json file .
